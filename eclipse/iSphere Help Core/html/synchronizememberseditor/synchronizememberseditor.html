	<h1>Synchronize Members Editor</h1>
	<a href="https://github.com/rdi-open-source/isphere/" target="_blank">

	</a> The Synchronize Members Editor lets you compare, edit and synchronize the
	source members of two source files or all source files of two libraries. The comparison
	clearly highlights the differences. Here is a sample comparison:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/synchronize_members_editor.png" align="middle">
	<h2>Comparing Source Members</h2>
	<p>
		Select one, preferably two, source files or libraries from the RSE tree and from
		the context menu (right click) select <i>iSphere Synchronize Members</i>r. If
		you select only one source file or library, then you need to
		open the second file or library from the compare editor.
	<p>Once there is a source file or library in both sides, click [Compare] to
		start a comparison.
	<p>The &quot;Ignore date&quot; checkbox specifies whether or not the last changed
	   Date and time of the source members is taken into account. If the &quot;Ignore
	   date&quot; checkbox is selected, the last changed date and time is ignored.
	<p>After the compare process finishes, note that icons between the
		two panes clearly display the differences.
	<h2>Filtering Source Members</h2>
	<p>Use the filter buttons in the &quot;Display&quot; section to
		filter the source members:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/filter_options.png" align="middle">
	<p>A checked button indicates that the relevant entries are
		displayed. Uncheck one or more buttons to remove entries from the
		display. For example, unchecking [=] will remove from the display all
		source members that are identical in both source files.
	<p>
		<img src="assets/synchronize_members_editor_filtered.png"
			align="middle">
	<p>The status bar provides information on filtered entries. In the
		two libraries compared above, &quot;Items found: 8/15&quot; means that
		8 out of 15 members are displayed. Then information about the possible
		compare status follows. So there are 0 out of 7 identical members
		and a total of 4 different members displayed. Last but not least there
		are 3 unique members at the left and 1 unique member at the right without
		a counterpart on the other side.
	<h2>Synchronizing Members</h2>
	Members selected to be synchronized are indicated by a right green
	arrow and a left blue arrow between the panes. A member that does not
	have an arrow will not be changed by the [Synchronize] button.
	<p>Use the context (right click) menu on members to set the left
		or right arrows in the direction you want synchronization to occur.
	<p>The complete context menu looks like this:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/context_menu.png" align="middle">
	<p>For example you may want to change the &quot;not equal&quot;
		action using &quot;Select for copying &lt;- (right to left)&quot; or
		using &quot;Select for copying -&gt; (left to right)&quot;. You may
		want to use &quot;Remove selection&quot; on members which are missing
		from one of the source files to avoid copying them to the other
		source file.
	<p>Note that you can also conveniently delete, edit and compare
		source members using the context menu.
	<p>Use the &quot;Existing members action&quot; options to specify what to do
		if a source members exists. Option &quot;Error&quot; means, that the member
		is not copied and marked as &quot;in error state&quot;. &quot;Replace&quot;
		means, that existing members are replaced silently.
	<p>When you are satisfied that you have all the left and right arrows set
		correctly, click [Synchronize] to make the changes. <b>Note:</b> There
		is no &quot;Undo&quot; after you click [Synchronize].
	<p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="notice">Note the &quot;Auto-Compare&quot; checkbox.
				If checked, the source files will be compared automatically after
				the files are synchronized. If not checked, changed table items
				which  no longer match the filter options are not immediately
				removed from the table. The items are kept in the table to give you
				a chance to change them again, without changing the filter options.
				The status bar always show the correct values according to the
				filter options. You can toggle a filter option of your choice to
				update the table view.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
    <p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="notice">Note the &quot;Display errors only&quot; checkbox.
                If checked, only the members that are in error state are displayed. That
                is helpful for identifying members that have not been synchronized due to
                errors.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
	<p>

		<h2>Comparing Source Members Side by Side</h2>
		<p>There are three ways to find differences by opening the compare
			dialog:
		<ul>
			<li>Double click a source member</li>
			<li>Select a source member and use the <i>Enter</i> key
			</li>
			<li>Right click, then click &quot;Compare left & right&quot; from the
				context menu</li>
		</ul>
		<p>

		<p>
		<h2>Notes on Comparing Source Members</h2>
		<p>
		The <i>Synchronize Members Editor</i> compares the date and time the content
		of the source members has been last changed. This information is displayed in
		SEU with option 8 next to the member in fields "Change date" and "Change time" .
		<p>
		You can select option &quot;Ignore date&quot; to ignore the last changed date
		and time when comparing the source members.
		<p>
		The content of the source members is not compared line by line, but by a CRC32
		checksum that is calculated on the host system.
		<p>
		<h3>Synchronizing on the Same System</h3>
		<p>
			The <i>Synchronize Members Editor</i> uses the <i>CPYF</i>
			command for copying source members. Because of the nature of the <i>CPYF</i>
			command, the last changed date and time of the source members are identical
			after the synchronization.
		<p>
		<h3>Synchronizing on Different Systems</h3>
		<p>
			The <i>Synchronize Members Editor</i> downloads the source member to the
			local computer and uploads it to the remote systems. Obviously the last
			changed date and time of the source members do not match after the
			synchronization.
